# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** into 10 categories. The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and optimized with techniques like **batch normalization, data augmentation, learning rate schedulers**, and **early stopping**.

## 📂 Dataset
**CIFAR-10** consists of **60,000 images** (32x32 pixels) across 10 categories:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

## 📦 Installation & Setup
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar10-classification.git
cd cifar10-classification
```

### **2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4️⃣ Run the Training Script**
```bash
python train.py
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes:
- **Conv2D** layers with **ReLU activation**
- **MaxPooling2D** for feature reduction
- **Batch Normalization** to stabilize training
- **Dropout** layers to prevent overfitting
- **Fully Connected (Dense) layers**

## 🏋️ Training Process
- **Train-Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing
- **Early Stopping:** Stops training when validation loss increases
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing learning rate, batch size, and filters
- **Data Augmentation:** Rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment

## 📊 Model Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Training & Validation Loss/Accuracy Plots**

Run the evaluation script:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## 🏆 Transfer Learning (Bonus)
For improved performance, we fine-tune a **pre-trained VGG16/ResNet model** on CIFAR-10:
```bash
python transfer_learning.py
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Implementing **ResNet-50 and EfficientNet**
- Exploring **semi-supervised learning**
- Experimenting with **GAN-based augmentation**
